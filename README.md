# reviews-project-ReactJs

This is the 3rd project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article so I can share it with the community once it's finished. In this app you see different reviews, go to next review and get a random review. Topics: • useEffect() => fetch data. • Conditional Rendering.
